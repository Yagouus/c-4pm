# C-4PM: A Conversational agent for declarative Process Mining

C-4PM is a conversational interface for Declarative Process Mining. 
It allows users to interact with a declarative process specification and its corresponding event log
to perform multiple reasoning tasks.

## Abstract

## Installation

### Basic requirements

> **_NOTE:_**  Creating a virtual environment is highly recommended. For best compatibility this 
> should be done using Python 3.10 as `python3.10 -m venv ./venv`. If you don't have Python 3.10 installed,
> you can do it (in MacOS) with `brew install python@3.10`

- Python version: 3.10
- Docker needs to be installed
- [Lydia]() needs to be installed and configured
- [NL2LTL]() is shipped within C-4PM (no need for separate installation)
- The rest of the required libraries can be installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Installing

### Training your own model

### Running

To run the conversational agent you need to run:
- A Rasa actions server
- A Docker container with [Duckling](https://hub.docker.com/r/rasa/duckling) running
-
